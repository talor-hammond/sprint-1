Q: Without using jargon, how would you describe the command-line to a lay person?
A: Command-line is an interface which gives you the ability to "direct" the computer purely through typing. It lets you create, remove, re-direct, copy & paste, and add to files / folders / directories (as you would with a mouse) -- just to name a few of the basic abilities the command-line grants you.

10 Terminal Commands:
- cd
    used to "change directory"; navigate to a new working directory by referencing the folder / directory after the command cd
- pwd
    prints the current working directory
- ls
    prints the files / folders within the current working directory; -l can be appended to print such in list format
- touch
    append "touch" with a filename and / or extension (.txt) to create a new file within the current directory
- rm
    removes a file; append w option -r to remove directories
- mv
    moves / renames a file
- cp
    copies file(s)
- echo
    takes an input (string, contents of a file), and "echoes" / re-directs it to a chosen output (or nil)
- cat
    outputs the of a file to the terminal; e.g. a text-file - $ cat text.txt
- exit
    closes the terminal / shell
